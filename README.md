Various tests utilizing Google's ML [Perspective API](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi).

To get this to work you'll need to sign up and obtain a Perspective API key
from google, then create a file named apikey.py in the top level directory with
```API_KEY = 'YOURKEYHERE'``` at the top.

Feel free to use this code any way you want, just give me credit.
